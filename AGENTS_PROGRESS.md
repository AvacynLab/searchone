# AGENTS Progress

## Recent Steps
- 2025-12-04 12:58:46 – Revisited the AGENTS TODO list: marked the search oracle, ingestion, graph, fact-check, conflict, and scoring subtasks as complete, updated `configs/research_scenarios.yaml` to prefer `search_oracle_tool`, and kept scenario/role instructions aligned with the new tool flow.
- 2025-12-04 13:02:00 – Added targeted E2E tests (`tests/test_e2e_research_oracle.py`, `tests/test_e2e_conflicts_and_facts.py`) that validate scenario enforcement of `search_oracle_tool` plus fact-check/conflict handling.

## Action History
1. 2025-12-04 12:58:46 – Filled in the former checklist items for search oracle, ingestion/parser, NLP, graph enrichment, reporting, and convergence redundancies.
2. 2025-12-04 13:02:00 – Added README updates, new scenario configuration, and end-to-end tests that record coverage/gaps and controversies.
